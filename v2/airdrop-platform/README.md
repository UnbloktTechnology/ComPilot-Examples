# Airdrop Platform

This repository contains the Airdrop Platform, which consists of two main components:

1. **Smart Contracts**: Located in the `contracts` folder
2. **Application**: Located in the `app` folder

## Repository Structure

- `contracts/`: Contains the smart contracts for the Airdrop Platform
- `app/`: Contains the NextJS application for interacting with the smart contracts and the ComPilot Identity SDK

For detailed information on how to set up and run each component, please refer to the README files in their respective folders:

- [Contracts README](./contracts/README.md)
- [Frontend App README](./app/README.md)

## Getting Started

To get started with the Airdrop Platform:

1. Set up and deploy the smart contracts by following the instructions in the `contracts` folder.
2. Set up and run the frontend application by following the instructions in the `app` folder.

Make sure to complete the smart contract setup before running the frontend application, as the app depends on the deployed contract addresses.
